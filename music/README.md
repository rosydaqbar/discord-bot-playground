## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check if bot token is correct in config.json
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in Discord server
- Run `node deploy-commands.js` to deploy commands

### Metadata extraction issues
- The bot uses `music-metadata` for extracting song information
- If metadata extraction fails, it falls back to filename parsing
- Supported filename patterns:
  - `Artist - Title.mp3`
  - `Artist - Album - Title.flac`
  - `01. Artist - Title.mp3`
  - `Title (Artist).m4a`
- Run `npm run check` to verify dependencies

### ES Module compatibility
- The bot handles ES module imports automatically
- If you see ES module errors, try: `npm install music-metadata@latest`
- The bot will work with limited metadata if imports fail
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in Discord server
- Run `node deploy-commands.js` to deploy commands

### Audio quality issues
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible
- Check if music files are not corrupted
- Verify sample rate settings in config.json

### Web UI not loading
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check console for error messages

### Local files not found
- Verify musicDirectory path in config.json
- Ensure music files have supported extensions
- Check file permissions
