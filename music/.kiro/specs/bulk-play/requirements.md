# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The bulk play feature allows users to queue entire directories of music at once using a new `/playbulk` command. This feature enhances the music bot's usability by enabling users to play complete albums, artist collections, or genre folders without having to add songs individually.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to use a `/playbulk` command to queue entire directories of music, so that I can easily play complete albums or collections without selecting individual tracks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/playbulk` THEN the system SHALL display an autocomplete dropdown with available directories
2. WHEN a user selects a directory from autocomplete THEN the system SHALL scan that directory for music files
3. WHEN music files are found THEN the system SHALL display them in an embed message showing all tracks to be added
4. WHEN music files are found THEN the system SHALL add all files from that directory to the queue
5. WHEN the directory contains subdirectories THEN the system SHALL recursively include music files from all subdirectories
6. WHEN no music files are found in the selected directory THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the `/playbulk` command to have autocomplete functionality that shows only directories, so that I can easily find and select music directories without typing exact names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts typing in the directory parameter THEN the system SHALL show matching directory names only
2. WHEN multiple directories match the input THEN the system SHALL display up to 25 directory suggestions
3. WHEN a directory name contains the typed text THEN it SHALL appear in the autocomplete results
4. WHEN the user types partial directory names THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy matching to find relevant directories
5. WHEN scanning for autocomplete THEN the system SHALL only return directories, not individual files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the bulk play command to respect the current playback state, so that it integrates seamlessly with existing music functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN music is currently playing AND `/playbulk` is used THEN the system SHALL add all directory files to the existing queue
2. WHEN no music is playing AND `/playbulk` is used THEN the system SHALL start playing the first file and queue the rest
3. WHEN the queue already contains music AND `/playbulk` is used THEN the system SHALL append the directory files to the end of the queue
4. WHEN the selected directory is empty THEN the system SHALL not modify the current queue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to receive clear feedback about the bulk play operation, so that I understand what files were added and the current queue status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `/playbulk` successfully finds files THEN the system SHALL display an embed message listing all music files found in the directory
2. WHEN `/playbulk` successfully adds files THEN the system SHALL display the number of files added to the queue
3. WHEN `/playbulk` successfully adds files THEN the system SHALL show the directory name that was processed
4. WHEN `/playbulk` successfully adds files THEN the system SHALL display the new total queue length
5. WHEN the embed message would be too long THEN the system SHALL truncate the list and show "...and X more files"
6. WHEN `/playbulk` encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the bulk play command to work with the same file formats as the regular play command, so that all my music files are supported consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading files from a selected directory THEN the system SHALL only include files with supported extensions (.mp3, .flac, .m4a, .wav, .ogg)
2. WHEN loading files from a selected directory THEN the system SHALL ignore non-music files
3. WHEN loading files from a selected directory THEN the system SHALL maintain the same audio quality standards as individual file playback
4. WHEN loading files from a selected directory THEN the system SHALL extract metadata for each music file using the same methods as `/play`

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the bulk play command to have proper error handling, so that I receive helpful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the specified directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display "Directory not found" error
2. WHEN the user is not in a voice channel THEN the system SHALL display "Voice channel required" error
3. WHEN the directory contains no music files THEN the system SHALL display "No music files found in directory" error
4. WHEN there's a file access error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message without exposing system details
